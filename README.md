# Sign-in form using React

Utilizing React concepts, I've developed a sign-in form. 

I've employed several React concepts in crafting a sign-in form, including state management through components, utilizing form elements, and employing conditional rendering. To enhance the page's visual appeal, I've applied simple CSS styling. The following steps outline the key features of the implementation:

1. **State Object for Input Values:**
   I've established a state object to efficiently store the four necessary values we need to retain.

2. **Unified `handleChange` Function:**
   To streamline input state management, I've devised a single `handleChange` function that effectively oversees the state updates for all inputs, ensuring correct synchronization.

3. **Password Matching Validation:**
   Upon clicking "Sign up," the system conducts a validation check to verify whether the password and confirmation match. When they align, the console logs "Successfully signed up." Conversely, if the passwords do not match, the console logs "Failed! Passwords do not match."

4. **Checkbox Condition for Terms & Conditions:**
   Upon form submission, if the user has marked the "terms & conditions" checkbox, the console logs "Thanks for reading the terms and conditions."

5. **Logged Object Details:**
   As a preliminary step, the console displays an object containing the entered details, enabling easy reference to the submitted information.

This approach showcases a comprehensive utilization of React principles, integrating state handling, form elements, and dynamic console output to deliver an interactive sign-in form experience.
